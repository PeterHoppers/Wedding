                <p >Peter and Maddy met in an advanced creative writing course at Carroll University his junior year and her sophomore year. Maddy's vivid writing and charming demeanor captured Peter and his insightfulness and sweet mannerisms stood-out to her. When Maddy dressed up as Link from Legend of Zelda for Halloween, Peter took a chance and asked her to accompany him to a Zelda concert in Chicago. From the first outing the two realized how much they naturally synergized. They could be complete dorks around each other without judgment, have fun doing the simplest tasks, and depend on each other when challenging situations arose.</p>
                <p>During college Maddy would bring Peter new movies for him to watch (all the How To Train Your Dragons), he would show her new video games (from the romance of To the Moon to the chaos of Nintendo Land), and the two would play lots of board games and have late-night conversations between their friend groups and families.</p>
                <p>After Maddy graduated, the two moved to Madison and visited each other basically every other day. To save driving all those three blocks, they decided to move in together. Which led to, well, here. </p>
